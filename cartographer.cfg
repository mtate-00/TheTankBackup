#   Offsets are measured from the centre of your coil, to the tip of your nozzle 
#   on a level axis. It is vital that this is accurate. 
x_offset: 0                          
#    adjust for your cartographers offset from nozzle to middle of coil
y_offset: 15                         
#    adjust for your cartographers offset from nozzle to middle of coil
backlash_comp: 0.00857
#   Backlash compensation distance for removing Z backlash before measuring

#canbus_uuid: 69dca5a60732
##   Path to the serial port for the Cartographer device. Typically has the form
##   /dev/serial/by-id/usb-cartographer_cartographer_...
##   
##   If you are using the CAN Bus version, replace serial: with canbus_uuid: and add the UUID.
##   Example: canbus_uuid: 1283as878a9sd
##
#speed: 40.
##   Z probing dive speed.
#lift_speed: 5.
##   Z probing lift speed.
#backlash_comp: 0.008825
##   Backlash compensation distance for removing Z backlash before measuring
##   the sensor response.
#x_offset: 0.
##   X offset of cartographer from the nozzle.
#y_offset: 19.75
##   Y offset of cartographer from the nozzle.
#trigger_distance: 1
##   cartographer trigger distance for homing.
#trigger_dive_threshold: 1.5
##   Threshold for range vs dive mode probing. Beyond `trigger_distance +
##   trigger_dive_threshold` a dive will be used.
#trigger_hysteresis: 0.006
##   Hysteresis on trigger threshold for untriggering, as a percentage of the
##   trigger threshold.
#cal_nozzle_z: 0.1
##   Expected nozzle offset after completing manual Z offset calibration.
#cal_floor: 0.1
##   Minimum z bound on sensor response measurement.
#cal_ceil:5.
##   Maximum z bound on sensor response measurement.
#cal_speed: 1.0
##   Speed while measuring response curve.
#cal_move_speed: 10.
##   Speed while moving to position for response curve measurement.
#default_model_name: default
##   Name of default cartographer model to load.
#mesh_main_direction: x
##   Primary travel direction during mesh measurement.
##mesh_overscan: -1
##   Distance to use for direction changes at mesh line ends. Omit this setting
##   and a default will be calculated from line spacing and available travel.
#mesh_cluster_size: 1
##   Radius of mesh grid point clusters.
#mesh_runs: 2
##   Number of passes to make during mesh scan.
